# GitHub-Issues-Tracker
### An iOS application to track open and closed issues on any GitHub repos through GitHub API

This is a simple iOS application, created using Swift Storyboard, as part of my assignment for the MPCS iOS development course for the University of Chicago's Master of Computer Science program.


This application contains tabs to allow users to track open and closed issues on their GitHub repos. It contains a detailed view page for a detailed description of the issue including the authors and the creation date. This app uses the GitHub API to obtain information.
